Go to 
Extentions -> Manage Extentions 
Enable the developer mode here and press the button says "Load Unpacked"
Select the folder that you clonned the repo and that's it

If you want to change the image, which I wouldn't, just delete the existing image and put the one you like with the **same** name.
